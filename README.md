## Installation

1. Download the right file of node.js to your computer and select what folder are downloading it.  If a Mac, then download the Mac node.js version, if a Windows user then the Windows's version.  2. Open VS code then open new terminal and find where the folder has node.js.  
2a. Create a new folder (mkdir) and label it 'challenges'.  then create another folder and label  it 'professional readme gen'.  
3. Pull the Challenge folder from your Node.Js Activities, copy the 'utils', .gitignore, index.js and package.json; and drop into the 'professional readme gen (prg)' folder.
4. Go to your GitHub and create a new Repo, include a license and ReadMe.md.  
5. Copy the SSH key from the green 'Code" button and go to your terminal to 'git clone' it.  First check a 'git status' and then a 'ls' to see if you are in the right folder.  Then do a command of  'git clone (paste the code from Github) and enter.
6. Check on your side bar in VS code if you see the ReadMe and License folder under your 'prg' folder.  if so, then do a 'git add -A', 'git commit -m "state here what you added", 'git push'.
7. Go to your GitHub and see if the new items populated in your Repo. If issues occur, check your if you are in the right folder and if you have the right code for your repo.  Note: sometimes when you git clone, the terminal may ask for your password.  Have it ready and written somewhere easy to find when prompted for it.  
8. Once you see the VS code matches folder wise with our GitHub, you are ready to begin on your code concept "Inquirer"
9.After completing the code, then do a test run.  Use 'node index.js' then enter and a prompt of questions will appear (one at a time) for you to answer.
10. Once completed, 'git add -A', 'git commit -m"what you commited"' then 'git push'.
11. Go to Settings in GitHub, then Pages select "Main" from the Branch section, hit Save and a link will appear.
12. Use that link to submit for others to see your work.
